# Chapter 0.1 - Introduction

## Is This The Right Tutorial For Me?

This is the point where I'm either going to intrique you or scare you off.  

If you just want to throw together a simple game and don't care about being good at programming,  
then I'm sorry but this isn't the tutorial for you.  

This tutorial is for people who want to be good at programming.  
This tutorial is for people who want to understand the code.  

It won't all be fun and games.

Sometimes there will be boring text walls discussing the theoretical side of programming.  
Sometimes I'll be rambling on about the philosophy of programming.  
Sometimes I'll write long opinionated rants.
Sometimes I'll quote famous programming figures whose names you've probably never heard before.  

I'm not doing these things on a whim, I genuinely think they will help you be a better programmer.  
If you want to be good, you have to understand the theory as well as the practise, and you need to understand the history of programming and some of the people who have helped to shape programming.  
You can't have your cake if you don't eat your broccoli.  

But I guarantee that no matter how much of a mess I make of this,  
if you manage to survive this tutorial then you will be well prepared for making your own games.

Also I appologise if English is your second language.  
This tutorial is going to be plastered with idioms, verbose semi-formal English and innumerable Britishisms (and maybe one or two Australianisms, but certainly no Americanisms if I can help it).  
That's just how I write, and it would be considerable mental effort to tone it down.
